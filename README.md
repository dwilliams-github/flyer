This is a simple video game, in which the player controls a little ship
that can fly around and shoot objects. The ship will be destroyed
if you hit something. It works in a similar fashion to the classic
[Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game))
video game (which I used to have a lot of fun playing in arcades).

This game was written in 1990 to run on a classic Mac.
The kind with a small black+white screen. Animation on these 
machines was not simple. This code used small sprites and wrote
directly into video memory in order to achieve enough speed
for smooth animation. The sprites were tiny (16 by 16 bits) 
and hand drawn. I wrote a routine in assembly to
copy the sprites directly to video memory.

I remember wanting to write this game because I lost the code
to something similar I wrote for a PC XT machine. That version
of the game would have been written in 
[Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) at 
the lab at MIT. Yeah, I was writing video games on laboratory
computers between experiments. I could get away with this because
I usually had the lab to myself.

By the way, I have no idea how to view the pictures. I assume
I drew them myself.
